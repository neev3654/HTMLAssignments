    <h1>The History of Computers and the Internet</h1>
    <hr>

    <h2>Early Computers</h2>
    <p>
        The history of computers began with <b>mechanical devices</b> such as the abacus, which was used for simple
        arithmetic. Later, Charles Babbage proposed the <u>Analytical Engine</u>, considered the <strong>first concept
            of
            a programmable computer</strong>. His work was expanded upon by <em>Ada Lovelace</em>, who is often called
        the first computer programmer. Early machines were huge, unreliable, and extremely costly, but they represented
        the beginning of a new era in technology. People in the <abbr title="Nineteenth Century">19th C.</abbr> could
        hardly imagine that these concepts would one day lead to <mark>modern digital systems</mark>. Even though these
        machines were limited, they laid the foundation for future <abbr title="Personal Computers">PCs</abbr> and
        inspired generations of scientists to innovate further.

    <h2>Generations of Computers</h2>
    <p>
        The <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> has evolved greatly from its primitive beginnings to the
        microprocessors we use today. The 1st generation used <mark>vacuum tubes</mark>, which were large and produced a
        lot of heat. In the 2nd generation, <i>transistors</i> replaced tubes, making machines faster and more reliable.
        The 3rd generation introduced integrated circuits, while the 4th brought <em>personal and affordable
            computers</em>. In the 5th generation, technologies such as <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>
        and <abbr title="Internet of Things">IoT</abbr> began shaping the world. We no longer rely on <del>punch
            cards</del> <ins>graphical user interfaces</ins> for interaction. Mathematical complexity also grew, with
        formulas like O(<var>n</var><sup>2</sup>) helping measure algorithms and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> often used
        in hardware manufacturing processes.

    <h2>Birth of the Internet</h2>
    <p>
        The <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> was invented by Tim Berners-Lee, but the story of the internet began
        earlier with ARPANET during the Cold War. Networking was designed for <strong>communication resilience</strong>
        and soon expanded to universities worldwide. Researchers wanted a way to share data across great distances
        quickly and efficiently. According to experts, <q>the growth of the internet has been one of the most
            transformative events in human history</q>. The ability to connect computers created a global system unlike
        anything before. As Tim Berners-Lee once said:
    <blockquote>
        "The power of the Web is in its universality.
        Access by everyone regardless of disability is
        an essential aspect."
        â€“ <cite>Tim Berners-Lee</cite>
    </blockquote>
    The early internet was text-based and slow, but it gave birth to ideas that still define modern digital life.

    <h2>Modern Era</h2>
    <p>
        Today, we use <del>dial-up</del> <ins>broadband</ins> and fiber connections, providing speed and convenience.
        Computers now fit in our <small>pockets as smartphones</small>, and cloud computing makes data accessible from
        anywhere. Social networks, e-commerce, and online education have changed how we interact and learn. Devices are
        interconnected in the <abbr title="Internet of Things">IoT</abbr> ecosystem, making everyday life smarter and
        more efficient. <strong>Cybersecurity</strong> has become critical as threats grow more sophisticated. The
        <em>digital divide</em> remains a challenge, as not everyone has equal access to technology. Despite obstacles,
        the modern era proves that computing and the internet are now inseparable from human progress.

    <h2>Computer Example</h2>
    <p>
        To display text on a webpage, you can use:
    </p>


    <pre>
<code>
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        Another example: Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to copy text.
        <br>
        System response: <samp>Text copied to clipboard.</samp>
    </p>
